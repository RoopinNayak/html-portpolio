<p>The sound of footsteps echoed in the hallway, each one a soft reminder of the past.
Her fingers traced the rim of her coffee cup, lost in thought as the morning unfolded around her.
The forest path seemed endless, the trees closing in like silent sentinels guarding an ancient secret.
He smiled softly, watching as the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the land.
